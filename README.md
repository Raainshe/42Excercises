## Introduction

The 42 Heilbronn Piscine is an intensive 4-week program designed to immerse students in the world of coding. This repository contains the various projects I completed during the Piscine, which helped me build a solid understanding of low-level programming, problem-solving, and software development practices.

## Projects

### Project 1: Shell Basics

**Description:**  
In this project, I learned the fundamentals of shell scripting. I worked on tasks such as writing basic scripts, handling command-line arguments, and manipulating files and directories.

**Key Features:**
- Basic shell script structure
- File and directory operations
- Command-line arguments

**Technologies Used:**  
- Shell

### Project 2: C Programming Fundamentals

**Description:**  
This project focused on C programming, covering essential concepts such as variables, loops, conditions, functions, and pointers. I implemented various small programs to solidify my understanding of these concepts.

**Key Features:**
- Implementation of basic algorithms
- Understanding of memory management
- Use of functions and pointers

**Technologies Used:**  
- C

## Installation and Usage
